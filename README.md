## Description

The SSMID is a set of three visible and near infrared datasets captured with two single sensor cameras (SSC).
The information acquired by such cameras was saved as RAW images. Images from the cameras are 
correctly registered as indicated [in the paper](http://www.cvc.uab.es/~asappa/publications/C__IEEE_IPTA_2017.pdf). 
Attempting to save as much as possible the whole of multispectral bands information, 
the SSMID datasets are packaged in a Matlab .mat file.

### 1.- Outdoor Multispectral Images with Vegetation (OMSIV) (OLD)
This dataset contains 533 nonregistered  Multispectral Images (MSI) with its respective ground truth for 
evaluation training stage). OMSIV.mat is a struct Matlab variable, it is organized as follow:

#### Last OMSIV update
The former OMSIV version had 533 pair of images (visible and multispectral). The new actualization turn to  532 raw images, of that only 500 have remained after the "Registration" process. Therefore, if you are going to use [updated OMSIV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0givAGTBMIwUDJYejhsUFV0RVU) just 500 images will be found.
