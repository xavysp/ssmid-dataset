## Description

The SSMID is a set of three visible and near infrared datasets captured with two single sensor cameras (SSC).
The information acquired by such cameras was saved as RAW images. Images from the cameras are 
correctly registered as indicated [in the paper](http://www.cvc.uab.es/~asappa/publications/C__IEEE_IPTA_2017.pdf). 
Attempting to save as much as possible the whole of multispectral bands information, 
the SSMID datasets are packaged in a Matlab .mat file.
